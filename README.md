## HeyðŸ‘‹ , Welcome on my GitHub

As a software engineering student, I'm on an exciting journey through the tech landscape! My GitHub activity might not be as frequent as expected because my studies involve engaging with multiple tools and environments such as Azure, GCP, and Gitlab.

On my GitHub, you'll discover a mix of private and academic projects. I invite you to dive in and explore what Iâ€™ve been working on.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in:

- Java
- Angular
- C# .NET
- Go

*Please note, I am still in the learning phase, so while I strive for excellence, everything may not be flawless.*
