## HeyðŸ‘‹ , Welcome on my GitHub

As a software engineer who just graduated, I'm on an exciting journey through the tech landscape! My GitHub activity might not be as frequent as expected because my studies and work involve engaging with multiple tools and environments such as Azure, GCP, Bitbucket and GitLab.

On my GitHub, you'll discover a mix of private and academic projects. I invite you to dive in and explore what Iâ€™ve been working on.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in:

- Java
- Go
- C# .NET
- React

*Please note that I am still learning, so while I am striving for the best, everything may not be flawless.*
